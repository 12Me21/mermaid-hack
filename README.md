PROOF OF CONCEPT
render mermaid diagrams to svg in node.js without a browser

run `node test.js`
maybe it works, sort of

requires rsvg-convert (you'll have to find it yourself idk. it's `librsvg2-bin` on apt)
(yes it needs an svg renderer to generate the svg, because it has to, e.g. determine how much space is used up by textboxes etc.)

aaa
